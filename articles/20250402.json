That is validated by the sentiment indicators in free fall, but less so in the economic data reflective of what businesses are actually doing.</p><hr /><ul><li>The first hard indicators of activity for March are out this week.</li></ul><p><strong>By the numbers: </strong>Private employers added 155,000 jobs in March, rebounding from the upwardly revised 84,000 gain the previous month, according to payroll processor ADP. </p><p><strong>What they're saying:</strong> \"Despite policy uncertainty and downbeat consumers, the bottom line is this: The March topline number was a good one for the economy and employers of all sizes, if not necessarily all sectors,\" ADP chief economist Nela Richardson said in a statement.</p><p><strong>Between the lines:</strong> ADP's employment report is not meant to be an indication of what the all-important government payrolls release might show on Friday. </p><ul><li>Still, ADP's monthly report should not be totally shrugged off. The jobs data is based on actual payroll data of tens of millions of U.S. employees.</li></ul><p><strong>The big picture: </strong>The report aligns with what is apparent in low weekly unemployment filings: The labor market is still on solid footing.</p><ul><li>For the second straight month, manufacturing was the standout sector. It added 21,000 jobs last month, after adding 15,000 in February — what ADP called \"stronger-than-average job gains.\" </li></ul><p><strong>The other side:</strong> That might be welcome news for Trump. He's vowed to revive the domestic manufacturing industry, which has reported dismal <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/03/30/stagflation-economy-inflation-growth\" target=\"_blank\">stagflationary</a> conditions as tariffs take effect.</p><ul><li>The Institute for Supply Management purchasing managers' index, a gauge of manufacturing activity, contracted in March<strong> </strong>after back-to-back months of expansion.</li><li>The prices index surged on the back of tariffs, alongside a weaker employment index as manufacturers shed workers.</li></ul><p><strong>\"The manufacturing economy</strong> is struggling, primarily due to the tariff uncertainty,\" Tim Fiore, outgoing chair of the Institute for Supply Management's purchasing managers' index, told reporters Tuesday.</p><ul><li>\"It's very hard for me to determine what the demand situation was because it was so overwhelmingly focused on tariffs, which is today's issue. Demand will be tomorrow's issue,\" Fiore said.</li></ul><p><strong>Zoom out: </strong>Trump-era trade policy moves faster than it takes to collect economic data.</p><ul><li>But respondents sent the Institute for Supply Management their updated information through the end of last month, reflecting a fresh snapshot of sentiment.</li><li>ADP's March employment report incorporates data across the entire month.</li></ul><p><strong>What's next:</strong> Economists expect the government jobs report — out Friday at 8:30am ET — will show 140,000 jobs added last month, only a slight slowdown from the 151,000 payrolls added in February.</p><ul><li>The unemployment rate is expected to hold at a historically low 4.1%. </li></ul>",

It gave employees the option of staying on payroll through September. </p><ul><li>At the time, federal unions urged employees not to take the offer, which appeared unlawful and they succeeded in getting a key deadline pushed back in court.</li><li>This time around, the offers are being viewed less warily. </li></ul><p><strong>Other agencies, </strong>including NOAA, had already offered workers a way out through existing federal programs that offer voluntary early retirement or voluntary separation.</p><ul><li>Some workers who did take the original buyout offer have told Axios they were uncertain whether or not to trust it, but felt they had no choice given the administration's job purge. For right now, they are still getting paid.</li></ul><p><em>If you're a federal worker who has taken a buyout or is contemplating one, you can reach out confidentially to Emily Peck on Signal at EmilyRPeck.71 or by email emily.peck@axios.com</em></p>",

    "title": "White House fed up with RFK Jr.'s sluggish press shop",
    "published": "Wed, 02 Apr 2025 09:00:00 +0000",
    "content": "<p>The White House is so frustrated by the lack of clear and fast communications by Health Secretary <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/03/31/rfk-hhs-centralize-power-restructure-layoffs\" target=\"_blank\">Robert F. Kennedy Jr</a>.'s agency that it has set up a parallel press shop, five top <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/politics-policy/donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\">Trump administration</a> sources tell Axios.</p><p><strong>Driving the news: </strong>The problem surfaced in February, after it took two days for the Health and Human Services Department to <a href=\"https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1895585297351799198\" target=\"_blank\">acknowledge </a>— by tweet — that a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/02/26/texas-measles-outbreak-first-death\" target=\"_blank\">West Texas child</a> had become the first person to die in the measles outbreak.</p><hr /><ul><li>White House officials blamed Stefanie Spear, a Kennedy adviser for more than a decade<strong> </strong>who RFK Jr. has empowered as his deputy chief of staff and gatekeeper.</li><li>\"The White House was like, 'Where the f**k is the statement?' \" said a White House official who was involved in the measles response. \"CNN was blaring this chyron about how Kennedy was silent, and there was just nothing from the department because of Stefanie.\"</li><li>On Feb. 26 — the day the Texas child died — Kennedy, long known as a vaccine skeptic, had minimized the measles outbreak during a Cabinet meeting. </li></ul><p><strong>Since the measles debacle</strong>, the White House communications team has handled more press relations on behalf of HHS than any other department, and often has acted as a contact between reporters and the agency.</p><ul><li>\"This shouldn't be the White House's job, but here we are,\" a White House adviser said.</li><li>Spear was unreachable by reporters last Friday after top vaccine regulator Peter Marks resigned and blasted Kennedy in a scathing resignation letter.</li><li>The White House was left to approve the department's response,<strong> </strong>the adviser said.<strong> </strong>Pharmaceutical stocks plummeted as the industry grappled with Marks' departure. A person familiar with the situation said the ouster was forced by Kennedy.</li></ul><p><strong>The big picture:</strong> The dysfunction at HHS has crucial political and policy ramifications. The department oversees disease response, so public communication is at a premium. Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" coalition also was key to Trump's election last year.</p><ul><li>HHS's career employees tend to be more liberal or moderate than Trump administration officials, leading to some friction and mistrust.</li><li>\"Bobby World\" Kennedy loyalists, personified by Spear, add a complicating third dimension.</li><li>\"It's a mess over there,\" another White House aide said. \"The [career employees] hate us and are always undermining us and leaking stuff to the media. And then there's this small circle of trust with Stefanie that hasn't expanded.\"</li><li>This dynamic has taken shape as HHS, like other federal agencies in the Trump-DOGE administration, has embarked on a plan for mass layoffs — <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/04/01/hhs-layoff-rfk-staff-cuts\" target=\"_blank\">10,000 people</a> in HHS's case.</li><li>Spear wouldn't comment for this story, but a statement issued through the White House said: \"The White House has a great relationship with Stefanie and HHS. We work closely day in and day out to Make America Healthy Again. It's disappointing that bitter, anonymous sources are attempting to create conflict where none exists.\"</li></ul><p><strong>Zoom in:</strong> It didn't take long for the White House to get concerned about the problems at HHS. Officials say Spear restricts access to Kennedy, scuttles ideas that make her uncomfortable, and insists on controlling messaging but then under-communicates.</p><ul><li>It's similar to how Spear essentially controlled Kennedy's star-crossed presidential campaign, two aides say.</li><li>\"Her lack of willingness to engage with the press and the lack of the campaign staff [taking] decisive stances on issues, really was detrimental,\" said Jeff Hutt, former national field director on the campaign and co-founder of a PAC supporting Kennedy's food and health goals.</li></ul><p><strong>To surround herself with allies, </strong>Spear had HHS issue a three-year, $2.5 million change order to an ongoing services contract with a consulting company so she could hire three former Kennedy campaign supporters and associates.</p><ul><li>They're supposed to write speeches and provide other public affairs work, according to a copy of the document reviewed by Axios.</li><li>Spear also imposed an extensive approval process for all sub-agency communications — including during the measles outbreak, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had been prevented from sharing its typical updates with the public and press.</li></ul><p><strong>Zoom out:</strong> The White House and supporters of Kennedy have grown frustrated by what they see as a lack of communication from HHS.</p><ul><li>\"We're leaving points on the field,\" one of the White House staffers lamented. \"At every step, the White House wanted the secretary to lean more into MAHA and it just bottlenecked with [Spear].\"</li></ul><p><strong>Flashback: </strong>Critics point to a series of moves by Kennedy's top aide that they say have been a drag on his department.</p><ul><li>On Jan. 21, Day Two of the Trump administration, Spear halted all department external communications, including the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports, which notify clinicians about the spread of disease. That action was leaked to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/01/21/trump-hhs-cdc-fda-communication-pause/\" target=\"_blank\">Washington Post</a>.</li><li>On Feb. 21, Kennedy quietly canceled development of a fourth Covid vaccine, saving $230 million. White House officials wanted the information blasted out, but it wasn't publicized until days later, in a leak to <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/multimillion-dollar-biden-era-covid-vax-project-halted-trumps-hhs\" target=\"_blank\">Fox News Digital</a>.</li><li>On March 2 — two days after his <a href=\"https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1895585297351799198\" target=\"_blank\">tweet</a> about the measles death — Kennedy finally penned a <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> about the outbreak. Information about the measles vaccine's effectiveness was buried toward the bottom of the statement.</li><li>The same day, he <a href=\"https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1896360977861582861\" target=\"_blank\">posted</a> about hiking in California's Coachella Valley.</li><li>On March 9, a department insider leaked to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-cdc-plans-study-into-vaccines-autism-sources-say-2025-03-07/\" target=\"_blank\">Reuters</a> that the CDC planned to study unsupported claims of a link between vaccines and autism. HHS refused to comment, initially at Spear's direction. The White House got involved and forced a response.</li><li>On March 10, Kennedy met privately with major food company CEOs to pressure them to limit food dyes. The White House wanted more attention for the initiative. It was scooped by <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/11/rfk-food-companies-hhs-maha-00224006\" target=\"_blank\">Politico</a> but wasn't as widely publicized as administration officials had hoped.</li><li>On March 11, HHS held its first \"MAHA Moms\" event <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/11/rfk-jr-maha-commission-meets-for-the-first-time-behind-closed-doors/\" target=\"_blank\">behind closed doors</a> with Kennedy, Education Secretary Linda McMahon, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. No press was notified. No professional photographer was there. Fumed one attendee: \"Stefanie was in charge and created a perfect press opportunity with no press, a perfect photo op with no photos.\"</li><li>On March 18, HHS announced an initiative called <a href=\"https://www.food-safety.com/articles/10237-fda-launches-operation-stork-speed-to-improve-infant-formula-safety-including-contaminant-testing\" target=\"_blank\">Operation Stork Speed</a> to call for healthy baby food. It got scant coverage because the department didn't work closely with the press about it, much to the White House's annoyance.</li></ul><p><strong>Between the lines: </strong>During the Trump transition, Kennedy's team wanted to unite behind an agriculture secretary pick for him to support.</p><ul><li>Spear favored <a href=\"https://advancingecoag.com/about-john-kempf/\" target=\"_blank\">John Kempf</a>, an Amish regenerative farmer and podcast host, a transition source said. Others wanted a more traditional pick: Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, a <a href=\"https://texasagriculture.gov/News-Events/Article/10206/OPINION-OUR-HEALTH-OUR-RESPONSIBILITY-MAKING-AMERICA-HEALTHY-AGAIN\" target=\"_blank\">Kennedy ally</a> who invented his state's farm-to-school lunch program.</li><li>Excited to meet Kennedy for the first time when the two were in Washington, Miller emailed him to have lunch. Kennedy responded by cc'ing Spear and asking her to set it up. Miller followed up with an email a day later and got no reply.</li><li>\"Never heard back from her. Still waiting on a call back,\" Miller told Axios. \"Kinda disappointing, actually.\"</li></ul><p><em>This story has been updated with comment from the White House.</em></p>",

Tariffs as negotiating tactic:</strong> \"If a Country feels that the United States would be getting too high a Tariff, all they have to do is reduce or terminate their Tariff against us. There are no Tariffs if you manufacture or build your product in the United States,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social recently, signaling the possibility of a tariff reprieve down the line.</p><p><strong>3.

    "content": "<p>The White House is seriously considering an Iranian proposal for indirect nuclear talks, while at the same time significantly boosting U.S. forces in the Middle East in case President Trump opts for military strikes, two U.S. officials tell Axios.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Trump has repeatedly said he'd prefer a deal, but warned that without one <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/03/30/trump-iran-nuclear-deal-bombing\" target=\"_blank\">\"there will be bombing.\"</a> His timeline is tight: Trump <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/03/19/trump-letter-iran-nuclear-deal\" target=\"_blank\">gave Iran a two-month deadline</a> to reach a deal, but it's not clear if and when that clock started ticking. </p><hr /><ul><li>The White House is still engaged in an internal debate between those who think a deal is achievable and those who see talks as a waste of time and back strikes on <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/world/iran?page=23\" target=\"_blank\">Iran's</a> nuclear facilities.</li><li>In the meantime, the Pentagon is engaged in a massive buildup of forces in the Middle East. If Trump decides the time is up, he will have a loaded gun at the ready.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the scenes: </strong>Over the weekend, Trump received <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/03/27/iran-us-nuclear-talks-trump-letter\" target=\"_blank\">Iran's formal response</a> to the letter he sent Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei three weeks ago, a U.S. official said.</p><ul><li>While Trump proposed direct nuclear negotiations, the Iranians would agree only to indirect talks mediated by Oman. </li><li>The U.S. official said the Trump administration thinks direct talks would have a higher chance of success, but isn't ruling out the format the Iranians proposed and doesn't object to the Omanis serving as mediators between the countries, as the Gulf state has in the past.</li><li>Both U.S. officials said no decision has been made and internal discussions are ongoing. \"After the exchange of letters we are now exploring next steps in order to begin conversations and trust building with the Iranians,\" one said. </li></ul><p><strong>Driving the news: </strong>The rhetoric<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/03/28/trump-iran-nuclear-weapons-deal-letter\" target=\"_blank\"> between Tehran and Washington</a> was already ratcheting up before<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.axios.com/politics-policy/donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\">Trump's</a> threat Sunday to bomb Iran if a deal isn't reached.</p><ul><li>On Monday, Khamenei fired back and said that while he doesn't believe the U.S. would attack Iran \"they will certainly receive a heavy blow in return\" if they do so. </li><li>Iran also lodged a formal diplomatic protest — channeled via the Swiss embassy, as the U.S. and Iran lack diplomatic relations — and warned it would \"respond decisively and immediately to any threat.\"</li></ul><p><strong>What they're saying:</strong> \"The U.S. has 10 bases and 50,000 soldiers in the region. ... If you live in a glass house you shouldn't throw stones,\" the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps told Iranian TV earlier this week. </p><ul><li>Khamenei adviser and former parliamentary speaker Ali Larijani stressed that if the U.S. bombs Iran's nuclear facilities, Iranian public opinion will press the government to change its policy and develop a nuke.  </li></ul><p><strong>Friction point:</strong> Trump <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/01/06/trump-iran-nuclear-deal\" target=\"_blank\">abandoned the 2015 nuclear deal</a> and argued that his \"maximum pressure\" approach would force Iran to sign a better deal. He failed to get a new deal, as did President Biden.</p><ul><li>In the meantime, Iran has dramatically increased its enrichment of uranium and is now effectively a nuclear threshold state — though Tehran insists it does not seek a nuclear weapon.</li><li>Iran also says it's unwilling to negotiate on non-nuclear matters, such as its missile program, which Trump and his team have previously said must be on the table.</li></ul><p><strong>State of play:</strong> On Tuesday, the Pentagon announced that it was sending additional troops and air assets to the region, and that two aircraft carriers —  Truman and Vinson — would remain in the region.</p><ul><li>Last week, the Pentagon sent several B-2 stealth bombers to the Diego Garcia military base in the Indian Ocean in a deployment a U.S. official said was \"not disconnected\" from Trump's two-month deadline to Iran.</li><li>The B-2 bombers can carry huge bunker buster bombs that would be a key element in any possible military action against Iran's underground nuclear facilities.</li><li>\"Should Iran or its proxies threaten American personnel and interests in the region, the U.S. will take decisive action to defend our people,\" Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement. </li></ul><p><strong>What to watch: </strong>A U.S. official said Trump doesn't want to go to war with Iran but needs the military assets to establish deterrence in the negotiations — and to be prepared to act if negotiations fail and things escalate quickly.</p>",
